The fisherman tells the story to his friend the hunter, spread his arms a meter and a half and says:
- Imagine, the day before yesterday I fucked a pike like this!
A friend says:
- And I was hunting last week. I killed a moose in the reserve, dragged it through the forest, and the huntsman met it. What to do? I had to kill the huntsman. I threw a moose, I'm dragging a huntsman, and two mushroom pickers are coming towards me. Well, I think I got it. I had to shoot two mushroom pickers, there was no need for witnesses. I pull all three of them out of the forest to the road where I left the car to transport and bury them somewhere else, a bus with tourists stops. They get off the bus to recover, they see me with the corpses, and I put them down one by one with a gun.
The fisherman was listening. He listened and said:
- You're a friend, I think you're lying.
The hunter responds:
- And you reduce the size of the fish, otherwise I'll shoot the whole bus like that!
