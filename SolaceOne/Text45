An archaeologist has arrived from a long business trip from Africa. A friend asks him:
- Well, how was the business trip, what interesting things happened?
The archaeologist says:
- Here's the deal... I was persuaded to cohabit by a hefty orangutan.
A friend says,
"Forget it! He won't tell anyone, he won't write.
The archaeologist is so sad:
- That's the point... He won't write, he won't call...
