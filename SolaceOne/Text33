Vasily Ivanovich and Petka were captured by the Belyaks. At the first interrogation, Petka immediately split up, he laid out all the military secrets to the whites. Vasily Ivanovich is silent as a fish at all good times. He is being brutally tortured, but he still remains silent. After another interrogation, they threw him into the barn half-dead. Later, the sentry looks through the window, Vasily Ivanovich lies all beaten up, knocks his fist on his head and says:
- Fucking concussion, well, at least I can remember something.
