The girl shares with her friend
- I was walking down the street yesterday. Black ice. I slipped, well, I still think I won't collect the bones... And suddenly, right on the fly, I was picked up by such a brutal guy, looked into my eyes and gently whispered so sexually:
- Well, you're a girl, be careful, otherwise you'll be fine!..
