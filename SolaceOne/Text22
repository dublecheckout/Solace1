One day Little Red Riding Hood went to her grandmother on a bicycle. In the forest, a Wolf runs out onto the road and breaks the whole bike to the Cap. Suddenly a Bear comes out and says:
- Gray, why are you running around in my forest?! Well, I fixed the bike quickly!
The wolf has nowhere to go, took up the welding machine, cooked the frame and wheels for a very long time. I fixed the bike and the Hat went on. Little Red Riding Hood came to her Grandmother, came in and asked:
- Grandma, Grandma, why do you have such big ears?
Grandma says:
- This is to hear you better, Little Hat.
The little hat asks again:
- Grandma, Grandma, why are your eyes so red?
Grandmother:
- From welding the fuck!
