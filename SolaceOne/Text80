The blacksmith holds a red-hot horseshoe with tongs. The peasant looks surprised:
- How hot she is!
The blacksmith says:
- Well, it's not that hot, if you give me a three-piece, I can lick it with my tongue.
The peasant:
- Come on! Don't feel sorry for your tongue!
But as usual, in anticipation of an exciting spectacle, he handed the blacksmith a three-piece. The blacksmith licked the three-piece and put it in his pocket.
