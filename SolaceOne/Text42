A new carer enters the cell and addresses the guests:
- Great dragons.
Everyone looked at him in disbelief:
- Well, that's great for you.
In the evening, the new guy was transferred to another cell, one of the convicts said:
- And who are the dragons? What color is it? It is necessary to send a horse to the proper person to interpret the concept.
They sent a horse and after some time they receive a reply note in which the messenger writes:
- Dragon: the same rooster, only the crest on the whole back
