Gay at the doctor:
- Doctor, my partner has been diagnosed with HIV and I think that I am also ill.
The doctor:
- Take tests, and then we'll see.
A gay man comes in a couple of days for the answers of the tests, and the doctor tells him:
- I'm afraid to disappoint you, the test results showed that you have HIV.
Gay is taken aback in confusion, and the doctor tells him:
- Since you have only the initial stage, there is a proven folk remedy that helps at the initial stage. Take a couple of liters of sour milk, finely chop the pickles there, add sauerkraut, a couple of fish herring. All this time you insist in the heat and drink it in one gulp.
Gay man happily thanks the doctor:
- Thank you Doctor, very much, you just brought me back to life.
The gay man ran away to prepare a miraculous drug and then a nurse came up, who heard everything and asked:
"Why did you tell him all this, he also tested negative for HIV.
A doctor with a sense of accomplishment:
- Let him sit on the toilet for a couple of days and understand why a man needs an ass!
