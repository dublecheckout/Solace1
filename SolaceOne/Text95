The woman turns to the doctor:
- Doctor, my husband suffers from Internet addiction, he spends days playing tanks without leaving his computer! He doesn't notice me at all!
The doctor advises:
- Make him jealous, let him know that you have another man. Then he will get distracted and switch to you!
A couple of weeks later, the woman came to the doctor again.
The Doc is interested:
- Did you do as I said, is there a result?
Woman:
- Well, I went to another man.
The DOCTOR:
- And what about the husband?
Woman:
- Now they're playing dancing together!
