Three school friends met. We haven't seen each other for maybe twenty years. The first asks the second:
- Well, how are you, how is your personal life?
The second one responds:
- Yes, everything is fine, husband General.
First:
- Wow, how old is he?
Second:
- 67 years old.
First:
- What about sex? Is she coping?
The second:
- Well, there is an adjutant, young officers! How are you, anyway?
First:
- That's great too! Well, my husband is a professor...
the second:
- How old is he?
First:
- 77.
The second:
- Well, no big deal. Is having sex with him probably problematic?
First:
- Well, there are junior researchers and graduate students for this. So there's nothing wrong with sex!
They ask the third friend:
- And what are you doing?
The third in response:
- So I'm the same whore, just not married!
