A convict enters the cell-a first-timer. In the cell, experienced inmates eat cabbage. The first step to them:
- Hello goats:
The convicts blew up on him:
- What are you, a rag-tag fraer, watch the bazaar! We forgive you for the first time, because you are a first-time student, next time we will teach you. So keep an eye on the broom and think about what to say.
The first-timer says:
- Well, I didn't really know, but you immediately flew in like roosters.
