The oligarch's adult daughter comes home and tells her father:
- Dad, I'm getting married!
The father asks:
- Who is he? A successful entrepreneur, a young politician, a famous athlete?
The daughter answers:
- I didn't guess. He's a priest in one of the churches in our city.
Father in a parental way:
- Well, bring your fiance to visit, we will get acquainted.
The priest came to visit them, sat down in the kitchen with the bride's father, drank 200 grams each, and his father told him:
- Do you know that my daughter spends $2,000 a week on hairstyles, manicures and restaurants? Can you give her that kind of money?
The priest says:
- Well, I will try, in the end God will help.
The father continues:
- Do you know that my daughter flies to Milan once a week for shopping? Will you be able to give her that opportunity?
The priest says:
- I will try very hard, in the end God will help.
Father again:
- Do you know that as soon as a new Porsche model comes out, we immediately take this car to her? Can you pull it?
The priest says:
I will try very, very hard, I will get a second job, in the end God will help.
They talked, finished, finished, the priest went home, the daughter asked her father:
- Dad, how do you like my fiance?
Father smiling:
- Well, he's a sucker! But it's so nice to be called God!
