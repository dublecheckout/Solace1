A friend asks the sailor:
- You've been sailing the seas and oceans for so many years... Did any really terrible cases happen during the campaigns?
The sailor tells:
- 10,000 talking dolls were uploaded once in America. We are sailing home and got caught in a strong storm. I was in the hold where the dolls were lying at that time. Suddenly, on the ninth wave, the ship tilted, the dolls all fell out of the boxes on the floor and all 10,000 in chorus:
- MA-MA!
