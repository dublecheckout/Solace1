A farmer came to the pub. He ordered 100 whiskies, waved in one gulp and exhaled, talking to himself:
- There are situations in life that you can't explain...
A familiar bartender heard and asked:
- What happened, John?
Farmer:
- I went out into the yard in the morning to milk a cow. I got tired of the bucket, and this half-assed brute kicked the bucket with his left foot. I tied the cow's left leg and fed the second bucket. So this is a stupid animal, I turned it over with my right foot. He tied the cow's right leg. I poured another bucket. This horned reptile brushed it away with its tail. I pulled the belt out of my pants, I'm jumping like a fool from behind the cow, I'm trying to tie my tail, my pants have slipped to the ground and at that moment my wife goes out of the house into the yard!
