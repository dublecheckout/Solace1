The cops are driving in a UAZ, they are driving a goat from behind. The weather outside is rubbish, rain, wind. They see the priest standing at the bus stop, all soaked. The servants of the law took pity on him, decided to give him a ride, and at the same time to make fun of him. The priest sat down in the UAZ and asked:
- Where, why are you taking the goat?
The cops answer:
- Yes, we are taking him to the theological seminary to enroll!
Father:
- But he won't... Will he stay a cop like that?
