A man with a bandaged arm walks into the doctor's office:
- Doctor, my arm hurts a lot! Maybe a fracture or dislocation?
Doctor:
Tell me, do your eyes hurt?
Man:
- My eyes don't hurt, just my arm...
Doctor:
- And my penis, maybe? Does it hurt?
Man:
- No! And actually, why are you asking such questions?
The doctor continues:
- Yes, because there is a sign on the door to the office with the fucking letters U R O L O G!
