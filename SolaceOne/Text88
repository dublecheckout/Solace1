To keep the local males away from the bitch, her father sprayed gasoline under her tail. To the curiosity of the little son, the father replied:
- I'm filling it up.
One day a couple of days later, the son runs home and asks his father:
- Dad, did you fill up the Bug today?
The father answers:
- No, son, I didn't fill it up today!
Son:
- Well, then it's clear why all the dogs are pushing her, but they can't get her!
