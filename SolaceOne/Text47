Two men meet in the next world. The first one asks:
- How did you die?
The second one says:
- I come home earlier than usual, the table is set, my wife is naked in the bedroom. Well, I think I got caught. I searched the whole apartment, but I didn't find her lover. He died of joy.
The first one is for him:
- You're an asshole! I would have looked in the refrigerator, both of them would have stayed alive!
