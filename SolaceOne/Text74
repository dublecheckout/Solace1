While hunting, a man wandered, wandered through the forest and came to the edge, and there was a house. He enters it, and there a monk and a dog are sitting at a table and playing cards. The man says to the monk:
- Even your dog has reached perfection.
The monk replies,
"She's still stupid." You see, he's wagging his tail, so he's scored trumps.
