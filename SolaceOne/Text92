The wife inspects the apartment and throws ideas to her husband:
- Look at what a terrible bath we have! Let's replace it!
The next day we went to the store. We bought a new bathtub. Replaced.
A day later, the wife to her husband:
- Well, look at what defective doors we have! We're changing it!
The next day we went to the store. We bought new doors. Replaced.
The next day, the wife again:
- Husband, look at what stupid windows we have!
The windows were replaced.
Wife:
- What an old refrigerator we have!
My husband couldn't stand it:
- Didn't you fucking look at yourself?
