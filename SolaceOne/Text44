The whole Chapaev division drinks the second day. Vasily Ivanovich, no matter what company he goes into, everyone has plenty of alcohol. He calls Petka to his headquarters and asks:
- Petka, where did you get so much alcohol from?
Petka says:
- Yesterday they recaptured the railway station from the Belyaks, and there is a tank on the tracks. The tank has the inscription C2H5OH. The fighters opened the tank, tried it, and for sure OH.
