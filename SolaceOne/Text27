A down girl caught a goldfish, and the fish tells her:
- Don't kill me, let me go, I will fulfill any three of your wishes!
The girl makes a wish:
I want my ears to be like an elephant's!
The fish moved its fin and the girl grew hefty elephant ears.
The girl makes up her mind further:
- I want my nose to be like a rhinoceros!
The fish wiggled its fin and the girl's nose stretched out and a hefty tusk appeared in the middle.
The girl makes her last wish:
- I want to have a tail like a peacock!
The fish moved its fin again and the peacock's tail opened behind its back like a multicolored fan.
The girl let the fish go back into the river, and the fish asks:
- Girl, why didn't you wish to become normal, mentally healthy, beautiful?
The girl replied:
- And what was it possible?
