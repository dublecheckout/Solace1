A businessman goes out on the balcony of his mansion in the morning in winter and sees "Kolyan is a goat!" on a snowdrift. Well, he immediately calls the head of the security service, so that he immediately finds out who allowed himself to do this. Two hours later, a security guard comes in and says:
- I have two pieces of news, one bad and one very bad.
Businessman:
- Let's go with the bad one.
The head of the Security Service:
- The urine belongs to your best friend, Anatoly Alexandrovich.
Businessman:
- Tolyan... That bitch!
- And what is the very bad news?
The head of the Security Service:
- The handwriting of your wife!
