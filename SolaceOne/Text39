There is a man standing at the bus stop with his fly unbuttoned. A woman passes by and delicately hints to him:
- Man, your store is open!
The man is so proud:
- Well, how do you like the store director?
The woman, smiling, answers:
- The director is not visible, only a drunken loader is lying on the sacks!
