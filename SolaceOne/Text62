The airline is recruiting pilots to work. After the preliminary selection, there were a German, an American and a Russian.
The director of the company asks the German:
- What is the flight experience?
The German replies:
- Five years.
Director:
- What amount would you like to receive?
German:
- Three thousand. A thousand for me, a thousand for my wife, a thousand for the insurance fund.
The director asked the American the same questions. American:
- Eight years. Six thousand. Two for me, two for my wife, two for the insurance fund.
The director asks the same from the Russian. Russian:
- God be with you, I can't fly at all, and besides, I have a fear of heights. And I want to get nine thousand! Three for me, three for you!
The airline director is at a loss:
- So, who's going to fly?
The Russian speaks:
- It's clear who! The German! He agrees for three thousand!
