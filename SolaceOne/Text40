Dad bought a bow. I hung a target on the fence at the cottage and let's take turns shooting at the target with Vovochka. Vovochka fired once again and the arrow flew over the fence to the neighboring plot. Since there was only one arrow, Vovochka went to pick up an arrow from a neighbor. He comes back and says:
- Dad, I have two pieces of news! I shot my neighbor right through!
Dad asks:
- I don't care! And what's the other one?
Vovochka answers:
- And Mom has both cheeks!
