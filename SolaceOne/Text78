Husband and wife dialogue:
- Dear, your grandfather's savings were burned in the savings bank, and your father's in the pyramid "MMM". Is it by any chance hereditary for you?
Husband:
- Come on, dear. No. I'm smart, I decided not to pay the bank huge interest on a ruble mortgage and took a foreign currency one.
