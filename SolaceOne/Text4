A man goes fishing on the lake in winter. He sees such a picture. The fisherman of the fisherman is swimming right on the ice.
The man says:
- Why are you guys completely freaked out by the cold?
One of the fishermen answers:
- Yes, my friend lost consciousness...
Man:
- Well, I don't know... as an option, he needed to do artificial mouth-to-mouth breathing...
The fisherman answers:
- That's how it all started!!!
