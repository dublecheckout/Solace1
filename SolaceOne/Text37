An employee in the office tells a colleague a story:
- Last week I took four days off, told my wife that I was on a business trip, and I fell in two floors higher to a young neighbor. I haven't left the apartment for three days. I think I need to go get some air, and at the same time throw out the garbage. I waited until late in the evening so as not to get burned in the entrance, went outside right in my bathrobe and slippers, threw the garbage out of the bucket ...
A colleague asks:
Well, what's interesting here?
The employee responds to him:
- Yes, I just came back to my house out of habit.
