A hare was walking through the forest, saw a squirrel in a moment fell in love and told her:
- Squirrel, let's live together?
Squirrel to him:
- Why, come on.
They live for a year or two, but they can't make children in any way. The hare says,
"It's probably because I'm a hare and you're a squirrel."
The squirrel thought:
- Well, probably. But let's go ask the wise owl for advice.
We came to the owl. The hare asks:
- Owl, we've been living together for years, we don't protect ourselves, and we can't have children. Is it because I'm a hare and she's a squirrel?
The owl responds:
- You fucking morons! It's because you're a boy and she's a boy!
