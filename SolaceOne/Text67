Vovochka's parents returned home from the cottage after the weekend. The whole apartment is upside down, a complete mess. Vovochka is sitting in the middle of the room with a glassy stare.
Parents are interested in:
Vovochka, what happened?
Vovochka:
- My friends came to see me.
Parents:
And where is our piano?
Vovochka:
- I gave it to you...
