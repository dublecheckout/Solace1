A girl approaches a man sunbathing in long johns on the beach and says:
- Shame on you! They would wear swimming trunks or shorts to the beach. And then long johns.
The man answers her:
- You see, I have a horseradish of such a size that it doesn't fit in swimming trunks or shorts alone!
The girl says with interest:
- Well, show me your dignity.
Guy:
- Give me a three-piece and I'll show you.
The girl took a three-piece bag out of her purse, gave it to the man, the man dumped his stuff, she examines the horseradish and says:
- Yes, it really is a huge root vegetable. Can I touch it?
Man to her:
- Tweet and touch.
The girl gave the man a tweet, touches him with two hands and says admiringly:
- Man, maybe I'll give you a hundred and you fuck me with this dick?
The man answers:
- Yes, if I had such a dick still standing, then I would not be in long johns, but in gold and diamonds...
