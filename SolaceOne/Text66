Teaching at a lecture at an agricultural institute broadcasts to the audience:
- A breeding bull-leader can perform up to twelve copulations per day.
A female voice from the front row:
- Repeat it. How much, how much can he do per day?
The teacher repeats:
- Until twelve!
Again, the female voice from the front row:
- Please repeat it louder for the last row!
A man's voice from the last row:
- And specify, is this indicator with one cow or with twelve?
Teacher:
- Of course with twelve!
A man's voice from the last row:
- Repeat it louder for the upstarts from the front row!
