A man gets a job as a salesman in a supermarket. The owner of the store says:
- Sales are a little tight now, there is not much to pay.
A man to him:
- Well, for now I'll work on some kind of minimum wage, and then we'll see...
he went to work and a week later the proceeds were stolen in the supermarket. The owner can't understand anything. I decided to observe the new employee. He went out into the hall and watched him communicate with the customer:
- There are excellent spinning rods and fishing rods, I recommend this one and this one to you.
The buyer says:
- Yes, I will take it.
The seller:
- Well, you won't go fishing under the open sky. Look at what kind of double-ended tent we have, it is very convenient to spend the night and take shelter from the rain.
Buyer:
- Indeed. I'll take it too.
The seller:
- Do not drag all the gear, tent and other strays on yourself. Here is a compact trailer, but at the same time very roomy. See how well everything goes into it.
Buyer:
- Your truth. I'll take it at the same time.
Seller:
- It's not a secret that you can't go fishing in any car. See what kind of SUV there is, which will take you to the very place under any road conditions. Moreover, you also have a trailer!
Buyer:
- Well, there will be a complete set. I'll take him too. Announce the amount.
Seller:
- That Will Be $93,000.
The customer took out the card and paid for the purchases. In the evening, the owner comes up to the seller and says:
- You sold famously for such a sum, starting with a couple of fishing rods.
The seller says:
- Yes, not with fishing rods. His wife sent him to get gaskets, and I suggested...
- What do you do at home for five days? Go fishing!
