A young girl gets from a friend's cottage. It's standing on the highway, it's already night in the yard, not a single car is heading towards the city, I imagined wolves in the forest. He stands and shakes with fear.
He sees a car driving very slowly. Driving by, a girl right on the move, stupefied with fear, jumps into the front seat, buckles her seat belt and sees there is no one in the car... not behind the wheel, not in the back seat. Gee, but there's nowhere to go, you need to get to the city. There is a sharp turn and a cliff ahead. The girl thinks:
- Here I am a sucker, I jumped out of fear into some kind of incomprehensible car, that's the catch.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a hand goes to the steering wheel through the driver's window and turns the car in the direction of the road.
The girl exhaled:
- Thank you, Lord!
In general, the girl drove to the city in the morning in this car, the car stopped at some bar, the girl jumped out of it like scalded, ran into the bar, drank 200 grams, lit a cigarette and thinks:
- Tell who, they won't believe you!
Two guys are sitting across two tables. One to the other:
- Look, that fool who jumped into our car when we were pushing her!
