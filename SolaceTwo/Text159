A man comes to the doctor and complains:
- Doctor, what should I do? My mind is on the verge of breaking down. It's all because of my wife. She is always ahead of me in everything. He earns more money than me, can drink more vodka than me, runs faster than me, beats me at chessâ€¦
Doctor:
- You definitely need to defeat her in some way, otherwise you will have an inferiority complex. Let's choose an option for what.
They came up with it in a couple of hours, a happy man comes home and tells his wife:
"I bet I can pee on the wall above you."
We went out into the yard, my wife lifted her skirt, lifted her leg and splashed two meters up on the wall. The man lowered his trousers, took aim, and his wife said to him:
- Come on, maybe you'll get up on the stairs right away. You do the same as me...
- Without hands!
