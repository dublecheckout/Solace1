The phone rings at the barracks location. A fighter walks by, picks up the phone:
- Hello?
A question from the tube:
- Tell me, how many service Volga do you have?
The fighter:
- Two Volga rivers. One is under repair, and the other is driven by an old asshole Polyps.
The question comes out of the tube again:
- And who is this, Polypov?
The fighter says:
- This is our unit commander.
From the tube:
- And what is a straight asshole, asshole?
The fighter:
- Yes, we still need to look for such assholes!
A scream from the tube:
- Fighter, do you know who you are talking to?
The fighter:
- no.
From the tube:
- You are talking to your commander, Colonel Polypov!
The fighter:
- Do you know who you're talking to?
From the phone:
- no.
The fighter:
- Well, goodbye then, old asshole Polyps!
