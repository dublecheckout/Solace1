The experienced man arrived on the next trip, enters the hut and the guests tell him:
- We have heard for you that you are a respected tramp. Fall down at the table, we'll make a hot brew right now.
They cooked chifir and drink from the cauldron in a circle. It's the newcomer's turn to drink and he says:
- Guys, don't get me wrong, but I only drink from my mug. They've been taught that way since childhood. Mother and father also drank from their mugs.
They pour it into his mug:
- Well, if that's the case, there is no bazaar.
The newcomer takes a sip of kefir and says:
- Good chifir, sweet as n%zda!
One of the convicts corrects:
- So n% it's not sweet ...
the newcomer:
- That's exactly why I drink from my mug!
