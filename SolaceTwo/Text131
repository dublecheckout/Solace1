The bandos kidnapped the merchant, brought him to the reservoir, shoved his head under the water and asked:
- Do you have any bucks?
Merchant:
- No.
Head under the water again:
- Do you have euros?
Merchant:
- No.
They dip it again:
- Do you have any rubles?
Merchant:
- Guys, you either dip deeper or hold it longer, you can't see a damn thing!
