A woman came to the market to buy something for herself. He sees a man standing there, and next to him is a sign "Substitute for a man." And there are jars of mosquitoes on the table. She turned to him with a question:
- What is this all about?
Guy:
- The latest, innovative means to satisfy women.
The woman asked again:
- Well, how does it work?
Guy:
- At home, undress, lie down on the bed, release the mosquito, and he will do the rest himself! If something goes wrong, here's my phone number.
A woman came home and did everything as the man said. The mosquito flew out of the test tube and sat on the ceiling and is sitting. A woman full of anger calls the specified number and yells at the man that the remedy does not work. Half an hour later, the man comes to the woman, undresses, looks at the mosquito and tells him:
- Look, I'm showing you again!
