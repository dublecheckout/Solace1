- Vovochka, how long have you been smoking and drinking?
- Since our neighbor died...
- Well, where's the logic?
- She led a healthy lifestyle, and one day she went to bed and did not wake up.
- It's amazing. So why are you drinking and smoking?
- So that one day, like her, the neighbors will not be surprised...
