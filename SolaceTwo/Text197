A man with nothing to do, fed his parrot a tablet of Viagra. The parrot has entered all the feathered animals in the yard and let's molest the owner. The man, in order to cool the parrot's needs, stuffed it into the freezer. After a couple of hours, he opens it, the parrot dusts off the sweat and says:
"Try it, spread the legs of a frozen chicken!"
