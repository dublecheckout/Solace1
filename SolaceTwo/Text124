Many years after the wedding, the wife asks her husband:
- Honey, what were you thinking about on our wedding night?
Husband:
- I thought I'd fuck you until you were crazy.
The wife got excited, lay down on the sofa and spreading her legs asks:
- And now, what do you think?
Husband:
- And now I think I've succeeded.
