A lion and a lioness lie basking in the sun. A hare runs up and gives a Lion a punch in the face and runs. The lion has zero emotions, the lioness is in shock:
- Lev, what the hell is this? You're the king of beasts, tear up the asshole!
Leo:
- Come on, young, cocky. To hell with him!
This story repeats itself several times. One day, the lioness finally couldn't stand it and blew up after the hare. He catches up with him, the hare ran into a pipe in a hillock, the lioness followed him, and got stuck in the pipe. The hare got out of the other end of the pipe, came up, tore off the Lioness and was gone. In the end, the lioness got out of the pipe, comes back to the lion with her tail between her legs, and the lion asks:
- what? Did you run to the pipe?
