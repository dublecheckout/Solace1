Two men are sitting in a clearing and drinking vodka. Suddenly, a group of roleplayers runs out of the forest at them. All sorts. Guys, girls, fantasy-style paper helmets, wooden swords, an Elf with a homemade bow... and they turn to the peasants:
- Hey peasants, did the orcs run through?
Men:
- What?!
Roleplayers:
- Well, everything is clear with you. Let's go take the fortress!
The roleplayers are leaving. One of the men looks at a bottle of vodka and says:
- No, it's time to stop with the "palenka"!
