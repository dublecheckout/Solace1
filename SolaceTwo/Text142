Two men drink beer and talk for life.
The first one:
- In general, I prefer marriages of convenience.
Second:
- By calculation? You married a sixty-year-old woman! She has two children and three grandchildren and not a penny to her name. I'm sorry, of course, but in addition to all this, she's also dumb and a bitch, which are few!
The first one:
- Well, I miscalculated a little!
