An out-of-control plane crashes and the commander sends a flight attendant to calm the panicked passengers. She goes into the salon and says:
- Dear passengers, you are participants in an experimental flight. The plane is about to dive into the sea, and then fly on, on the set course!
The plane hits the water, falls apart, two Odessans are floating in the wreckage and one says to the other:
- Sema, I still did not understand this joke! Did they leave without us?
