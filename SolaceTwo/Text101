An intelligent couple of a respectable age has sex.
A woman with a broken breath:
- Nikolai Petrovich, a little to the left, please.
- Nikolai Petrovich, please, a little lower.
- Nikolai Petrovich, a little to the right, if it's not difficult for you.
Nikolai Petrovich, without showing irritation, stopped, groped for glasses next to him, put them on, with a look of undivided intelligence, defiantly looked into the eyes of his partner and asked:
- Elena Sergeevna, Mother, would you be so kind as to answer, who is listening to whom, am I listening to you or are you listening to me?
