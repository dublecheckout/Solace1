In Africa, three white guys in a cafe are sitting at the bar, drinking. The door opens and a black man enters, about two meters tall, healthy. He goes up to one of the white customers, drinks his glass and says:
- I'm a white women fuck@l!
The first one is scared:
- It's your business, I can't say anything about it.
The Negro approaches the second white man, drinks his glass and says:
- I'm a white women fuck@l!
The second one is scared:
- I'm happy for you. You're just great!
The Negro goes up to the third white man, drinks his glass and says:
- I'm a white women fuck@l!
The third:
- Well, that's right! For me, blacks also cause some kind of disgust.
