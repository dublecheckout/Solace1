An American and a Russian compete to see who can last longer underwater.
An American dived, and three minutes later the journalists surfaced to him:
- Tell me, how did you manage to hold out for so long?
American:
- Many years of training.
The Russian dived in. Not for a minute, the second, the fifth. Ten minutes later he comes up, he can't catch his breath, his lips are blue. Journalists are asking him:
- Do you need many years of training to achieve such results?
Russian:
â€“ Yes, what the hell years of training, just my underpants caught on a snag!
