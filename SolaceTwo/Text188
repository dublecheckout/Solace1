During the Great Patriotic War, a Soviet boy was walking, and a German spy dressed as another boy approached him and began a dialogue with him. During their conversation, a woman called out to a Soviet boy from the window of the house opposite and he said:
- My name is eat.
And the disguised spy boy said:
- And my name is Ivan.
That's how a Soviet boy exposed a German spy!
