Two advanced users are talking. One teasing asks:
- Well, how was the date yesterday? Did you get enough sleep?
The second one responds:
- No, I didn't get enough sleep, but not at all because of that, which is what you're implying. Now I'm thinking, should I get married now or wait some more?
The first one:
- What? You've only known each other for a couple of days!
The second one tells:
- Come to me. They started kissing, undressing, and the girl was like, what's flashing on your monitor? I see the ept virus! I'm saving the system on my computer! I'm all on explosion, I'm trying to revive the computer, but it just hangs and hangs! I'm trying to log in to it via the remote, I can't in any way! As a result, I remembered that I came with a girl in the early morning, when, after long silent waits, she brought me coffee and sandwiches.
The first one, after listening carefully, says:
- Of course, get married, my friend! Do not delay, sign up today, otherwise they may intercept!
