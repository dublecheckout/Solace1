The village grandmother called the telephone foreman. The master comes and is interested:
- What happened?
Grandma tells me:
- They tell me that I haven't answered the phone for a very long time, not everyone is waiting, they hang up thinking that I'm not there. But I answer the phone as soon as it starts ringing. For some reason, the dog always whines just before the bell rings, as if she is clairvoyant.
The master opened the switchboard, took out his mobile phone and called his grandmother. The phone did not ring immediately, but only after the dog whined. After digging into the wires, the master found out:
1. The dog is tied to the grounding of the telephone wire with an iron chain and a collar;
2. The grounding conductor is poorly connected to the lightning rod, thereby breaking the circuit;
3. The dog received 90 volts on an incoming call;
4. After several electric shocks, the dog began to whine and peed;
5. The moistened earth closed the circuit and the phone rang.
