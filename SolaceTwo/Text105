My grandfather wakes up at night, looks out the window, and they steal potatoes in his garden. He calls the police. The attendant answers:
- We apologize, but there is not a single patrol car in the vicinity. Wait for it.
Grandfather calls back in 5 minutes and says:
- I called you a few minutes ago, you don't have to come, I put all the thieves out of my gun!
Two minutes later, several patrol cars arrive, the police, riot police, knit thieves, the chief comes up to the grandfather and says:
- Grandfather, you said that you put everyone out of the gun!
Grandfather:
- Well, your duty officer also told me that there are no patrol cars!
