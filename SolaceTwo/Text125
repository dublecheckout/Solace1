The little son asks his father:
- Dad, what is politics?
Father:
- Let me explain with the example of our family.
- I earn money, so I am the Ministry of Finance. Mom runs the household, so she's the government. Grandpa makes sure that the house is in order, he is a trade union. The housekeeper does all the housework, she's working class. Everything we do is for you, so you are the people. And your one-year-old brother, the future. Understood?
The son answers:
- No, I didn't understand.
Father:
- Well, then go to bed.
In the middle of the night, the son wakes up to his brother crying. He gets up and goes into the bedroom and wakes up his mother. After unsuccessfully trying to do this, he goes to the kitchen, where dad makes love to the housekeeper, and grandpa watches through the keyhole. Then he goes back to his bed and continues to sleep. In the morning he meets his father and says:
- Dad, I think I've figured out what politics is.
Father:
- Come on, tell me.
My son tells me:
- This is when the Ministry of Finance fucks the working class, while the government sleeps, and the trade unions are watching from the sidelines. At the same time, no one cares about the people, and the future is in the shit.
