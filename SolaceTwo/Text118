Friends are sitting at the bar drinking. Suddenly, around midnight, one is abruptly blown up and on the way out. Friends follow him:
- Sanek, where did you go so fast?
Sanek:
- I'm going to the theater!
Friends to him:
- What a theater, it's midnight in the yard...
Sanek:
- So now my wife will come to meet me after the performance!
