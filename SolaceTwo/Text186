Two are getting divorced. The lady is slender and prominent, the peasant is not tall and is puny. Judge:
- What is the reason for the divorce from your husband?
Lady:
"Your Honor, he doesn't satisfy me as a man.
The peasant jumps up and screams:
- Yes, she's lying all the time! She doesn't feed me at all! Give me a bowl of borscht and I'll get everyone here!
