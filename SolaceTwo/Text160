The priest's husband drank it down. He's been drinking for a month, there's a row at home, he's abandoned the parish. The priest, desperate, prays to God:
"Lord, give him some reason, guide him on the right path, turn him away from this scourge!
In the evening, the priest is angry, drunk in the trash, comes home and hits his wife in the eye from the doorstep!
The priest 's wife:
- For what?
Pop:
- And there's nothing to complain about me to the authorities!
