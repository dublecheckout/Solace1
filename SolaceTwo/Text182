A man comes into the photo studio with a hangover and slightly rumpled. Addresses the receiver:
- You see, I spent this weekend with my mistress, telling my wife that I was going fishing. If she checks, then I'm in! Is it possible to take some real photos for proof?
The receptionist:
- Yes, no problem. We'll arrange it now.
They enter the studio. In the studio, the background is a tropical beach with umbrellas and a couple of girls in bikinis.
Guy:
- What is this?
Receptionist:
- This is a photo shoot for social networks "How I rested in Cuba"
The receptionist escorts the girls out, gives the man a fishing rod, looks around and says:
- Let's leave the background, it's very suitable!
