It's spring, but the ice on the river hasn't come off yet. Kolya is skating, and Petya is watching him from the shore. Petya shouts to Kolya:
- Don't skate near that place, the ice is already thin there!
But suddenly the ice cracks and Petya falls into a wormwood under the ice. Petya rushes to and pulls him ashore. I took off his skates. The adults arrived in time, praising Petya:
- Boy, you're a real hero! You're doing everything right, your little brother needs to be undressed and warmed up!
Petya, carefully examining the skates, says:
- These skates are worth almost ten thousand! And this bastard almost drowned them!
