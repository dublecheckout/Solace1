Lena, in tears and snot, calls her friend:
- Svetik, imagine, I came home early, and my husband is in the bedroom talking to some girl!
Sveta:
- And what are you doing at home now?
Lena:
- yes. I'm sitting like a fool in the kitchen, waiting for them to finish.
Sveta resets the call and whispers:
- It's n%good! Yours is sitting in the kitchen!
