The godfather asks the godfather:
- Godfather, keep an eye on the moonshine machine, I have to go to the neighboring village here.
The second godfather:
- And what should be done?
The first:
- Yes, it's easier than a turnip. Put the cans under the coil here, and pour two buckets of water inside. That's it!
My friend sat down at the machine, changed several cans, then took buckets and went to get water. He returns, and there are two policemen in the house:
- Well, what are we going to draw up a protocol?
A friend:
- Write it down. So I'm walking down the street, I see smoke coming from my friend's hut. Well, I think it's a fire. I ran for two buckets of water, I go into the hut, and there it turns out that two cops are driving moonshine!
