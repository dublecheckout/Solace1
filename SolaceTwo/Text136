The guy is going to submit a declaration to the tax service. Thinking:
- To put on dirty clothes, they will think I work from morning to evening, I earn a lot of money. To put on a suit, they will definitely think there is a lot of money.
I decided to ask my wife for advice, and she tells him:
- When I married you, I asked my mother which nightgown to wear on my wedding night, plain or silk. To which my mother replied that no matter what you put on, you are still %booth.
