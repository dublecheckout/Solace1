In the Seventies, a pioneer was dismantled at a pioneer meeting, who made an incorrect proposal to a classmate, at that time. The pioneer explains:
- It's not my fault! Masha and I were sitting on a bench and I saw two cats kissing on the roof of the house. I suggested Masha to follow their example. But since I'm a little confused and while I was saying my sentence, she turned her head to look, and the situation on the roof has already changed dramaticallyâ€¦
