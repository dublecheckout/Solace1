- Good afternoon! We're doing our coverage from our Special Olympics. There is no doping control at our Olympics. Yes, yes, athletes are not tested for doping. So…
- A Finnish athlete jumped 27 meters. A very, very good result for a chess player.
"Thirteen dead and sixty wounded. This is the result of an unsuccessful throw in curling.
- A Russian athlete has just made a pole vault. The audience is eagerly waiting for him to land...
- The javelin throwers were especially pleased today. Two downed Boeing aircraft... and one Russian athlete.
- For the third hour now, the Chinese gymnast has been spinning on the crossbar…
- The Organizing Committee decided not to release hammer throwers today, for safety reasons.
- Well, the marathon is traditionally won by a runner from Kenya. He's the only one who made it to Kenya.
- It has just become known that the entire organizing committee has disappeared somewhere. And then the hammer throwers come out onto the court.
- A Canadian cyclist forgets his bike in a hurry, but this does not prevent him from reaching the finish line first!
- The Chinese gymnast continues to spin on the crossbar…
- The hammer thrower makes a throw... and the Chinese gymnast seems to have finished spinning.
- And in conclusion, our sorokoborye. We are watching the performance of the Russian all-around athlete. Here he runs a thousand meters. He jumps with a pole. He takes the barbell. I ran a hundred meters. I put down the barbell. The puck, the puck! Check, check again! Goooool! But no, the barbell! And the Russian all-rounder enters the second round.
