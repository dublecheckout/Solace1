A man went into a public toilet. He took off his pants in the booth, sat down, relieved himself. In the next booth, he hears a voice:
- Hi.
Guy:
- hello.
Voice:
- How are you?
Guy:
- Yes, it's fine.
Voice:
- What are you doing?
Guy:
- Shit, what am I doing!
Voice:
- Let me call you back. There's some moron in the next booth answering my questions!
