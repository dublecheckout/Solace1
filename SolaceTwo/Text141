A guy came to a psychiatrist and said.
- Doctor, I have been having the same dream every night for three months, as if I was pulling a train from Krasnodar to Adler, and in the morning I feel so tired and broken, as if I really dragged it. What do you recommend?
The doctor advises:
- Before going to bed, convince yourself that you will pull the composition only to the Hot Key, and then as they want!
The man thanked the doctor for the advice and left. A week later, he comes back to the same doctor and tells him:
- Now I have another dream. It's like I'm having sex with ten girls all night and I can't even move in the morning. What should we do now?
The doctor advises:
- - Before going to bed, convince yourself that you should sleep with only four girls, and let him sleep with the rest who wants to.
The man clarifies:
- Doctor, is it possible with only two?
- I just have to drag this fucking train to the Hot Key later!
