Husband and wife come to the seashore.
Wife:
- Let's go for a swim!
Husband:
- Fuck it, the water is icy!
Wife:
- Well, we'll do it quickly!
Husband:
- The wave is high!
Wife:
- So we're shallow!
Husband:
- All right, come on.
The wife goes into the water and thinks:
- Well, mine is as usual, in a quick and shallow way...
