A guy came to the travel agency.
- I want to go I don't know where.
- Cyprus, all inclusive, by plane!
- Not safe. Planes are falling.
- Sunny Greece. By steamer!
- It's not safe. Steamships are sinking.
- Bus tour of Europe!
- No, it's not. So many accidents on the roads!
- Then a walking tour with a sexual bias!
- How is it?
- Go to x%y!
