Late evening. Fog. A drunk man is walking through the park. A white horse's muzzle appeared out of the fog and the man clearly heard:
- Good evening!
The man, feverishly thinking that he was visited by delirium tremens, answers:
- Hello to you too.
The horse continues:
- Where are you from? Where to?
The man, continuing the dialogue, just in case, begins to rummage in his pockets for cigarettes, matches, everything that is required when such questions are asked at night in the park:
- I'm from Medvedkovo, I'm making my way home.
The horse sniffed and snorted:
- Have you been using today?
The man, thinking that the smell of fumes had already disappeared into the fog, clearly replied:
- No, not a gram at all!
Horse nodding his muzzle:
- Well then. sorry to disturb Do you need a ride?
Guy:
- No, no, you're a horse, don't worry, I'll get there, there's not far to go to the house.
Horse:
- Goodbye. Be careful in thick fog.
The man nervously lighting up:
- Goodbye white horse.
The horse began to disappear into the fog to the laughter of the mounted police patrol...
