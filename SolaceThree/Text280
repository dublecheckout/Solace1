The woman went into the pharmacy, approached the pharmacist, looking earnestly straight into his eyes, said:
- Tell me, do you have cyanide on sale?
Her pharmacist:
- Excuse me, but why do you need cyanide?
Woman:
- I want to poison my husband.
The pharmacist began to wail:
- My God, what is happening to people... I can't sell you cyanide. It's against the law! I'll lose my license, and you'll go to jail, and me too! No, please!
A woman takes out a photo from her purse where her husband is having fun in bed with the pharmacist's wife.
The pharmacist changed his face and said:
- Well, you would immediately say that you have a prescription!
