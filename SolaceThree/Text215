A guy came to the pharmacy:
- Give me a pack of scumbags.
Druggist:
- Can't you say it more culturally?
Guy:
- Give me a pack of condoms.
Druggist:
- Well, if it's even more cultured?
Guy:
- Please give me a pack of contraceptives.
Druggist:
- Well, that's it. And even more cultured?
The guy throws his dick on the counter:
"Would you be so kind as to dress this gentleman?" You are welcome!
