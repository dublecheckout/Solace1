Vovochka came to visit his grandmother. Grandma asks him:
- Are the parents fighting again?
Vovochka answers:
- Yes, they swear. Mom brought some kind of clap from the resort. I gave it to my dad, Uncle Seryozha and a neighbor from the apartment opposite. Everyone is yelling at each other now. I just don't understand if I didn't bring enough, or if I didn't divide it equally.
