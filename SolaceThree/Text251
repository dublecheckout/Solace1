Mom, dad and ten-year-old son get off the tram at the stop. The mother nervously pulls the hood over her son's hat with the words:
- You're cold!
The son reists:
- Well, Mom, don't, I'm not cold!
The mother continues:
- And I say, you're cold.
The father watched all this, then pulled off his wife's hat and said:
- You're hot!
The wife started up:
- Are you sick? I'm not hot!
Father:
- So he's not cold either.
