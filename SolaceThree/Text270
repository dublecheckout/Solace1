Husband and wife make love with cancer. The wife wanted a variety and she offers:
- Darling, come on, as if we're in the rain, take a watering can and water my back.
Her husband waters her with a watering can and continues... The wife throws ideas on:
- It's raining, but the lightning is not flashing.
The husband moves the floor lamp and pulls the rope with one hand, pours water from the watering can with the other. Wife:
"Where's the thunder?"
The husband pulls the rope with one hand, pours water from a watering can with the other, knocks on the basin with his foot... Then he throws everything and tells his wife:
- Well, fuck you in this weather!
