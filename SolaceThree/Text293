Two traffic cops are driving along the highway and on the rear window of the car in front there is an announcement of its sale. The Gaians decided to call the guy and fine him for a phone conversation while driving. One of them calls, asks, and the guy answers on the speakerphone. The traffic cop says:
- Sorry, I can't hear you well, pick up the phone!
Guy:
- It's not very convenient. It's just that two faggots in a traffic police car got behind me.
