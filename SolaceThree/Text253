The wife and her lover are lying on the bed, suddenly the husband suddenly comes and rings the doorbell. They are undermined, but the lover has sciatica, stands naked on all fours and cannot move. The husband enters and, seeing all this, asks:
- Excuse me, what's going on here?
The wife responds:
- Dear, this is a Japanese robot for satisfying women in the absence of a man.
The husband believed and calmed down. My wife went to the kitchen to cook dinner. My husband's thoughts:
- Well, the Japs will come up with everything. It's a pity the women didn't make a robot, although the robot is not a human being, it's not pederasty, but I'll try.
She tries to enter her lover's anus, but he strained and wouldn't let her. Husband:
- A flaw in the process. So, where's my drill and rasps?
Suddenly the lover says in a metallic voice:
- Che-lo-century, on-the-buoy e-sh!
