I gave my wife a seven-colored flower for March 8.
- And?
- No diets and we are not getting fat, we have been without sick leave for a year now.
- What else?
- I earn a lot now.
- Cool! And also?
- Quit drinking and smoking.
- Go on!
- I like to cook, mess around in the kitchen.
- And every day at six in the evening, some unknown force carries me home.
- And from the bowling alley?
- From absolutely anywhere. As a result, I hate football and hockey, I hate fishing and hunting, but figure skating, TV series, shows about love, it's just mine!
- Wait, wait, and the seventh petal. There are seven of them, aren't there?
- Come on, guys, we are not small children measuring pussy, especially since you have no chance...
