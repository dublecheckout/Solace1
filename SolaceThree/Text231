The man decided to buy his wife a birthday present. He came to the store and saw there a fancy iron, which his wife had long dreamed of. And since there is no money for such an iron, he decided to steal it, but the guards spotted him and dragged him to the owner of the store. And the owner of the uncle is a prankster and says to the man:
- If you can carry this iron to the exit on your penis, the iron is yours!
The man gathered all his strength and dragged the iron to the exit. Owner:
- A deal is a deal. The iron is yours!
A man gave an iron to his wife, she was very happy with the gift, but that night her husband did not go to bed with her, but lies down in another room. The same thing is repeated on the second day, on the third, and so on for several weeks. Finally, the wife decided to check what was the matter. She enters her husband's room in the middle of the night and sees that he is standing in front of the mirror with his pants down, a kettlebell is hanging at the end, and there are other weights nearby. The wife asks:
- What are you doing, pervert?
The husband says:
- Do not interfere with training, we will take the refrigerator next week!
