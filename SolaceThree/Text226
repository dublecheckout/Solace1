The guy stopped for the night at a hotel. An hour later, he runs to the hotel receptionist and starts yelling:
- I don't understand, what kind of hotel is this?
The administrator drops everything:
- Calm down. What's the matter with you?
Guy:
- Oh, what happened to me... And here's what happened to me. When I entered my room, there was a guy with a gun waiting for me. Then he put a gun to my temple and told me to get on my knees and give him oral pleasure if I didn't want the contents of my head scattered all over the room.
The administrator with sympathy:
- Oh, my God, what a horror. What did you do in this situation?
The man is unhappy:
- Are you a moron? He's also asking what! Did you hear the shot?
