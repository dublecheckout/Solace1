The father announces to his son that tomorrow we will go to mow hay. Son of course:
- I will not mow!
His father took him in his arms in the morning and went to the field. They came and the father remembered that he had forgotten to take drinking water and sent his son to the village to get water. The son came home and saw his mother having sex with a neighbor. I decided to wait. The mother says to the neighbor:
- You throw your shirt on a haystack so that when I bring lunch to you, I come to you, and not to my husband.
The son returns to the field and sees his father rushing the mare. Well, I waited until the process was over. He goes up to his father and says:
- Mother ordered you to throw your shirt on the stack so that it would get to you and not to the neighbor.
Well, my father did so. The mother came and got to the father. There is nothing to do, I stayed, I did not run to my neighbor with my husband. A father tells his son:
- Go to the neighbor and take our firstborn to him, otherwise he looks sad.
The son of the first one drank comes to the neighbor and says:
- My father found out that you're fucking my mom, he's going to kill you with an axe.
The neighbor didn't believe me. The son returns and tells his father:
- The neighbor's cart broke down, he asks for an axe.
The father takes an axe and goes to the neighbor. The neighbor saw it and let's run away, the father is after him. The mother asks her son:
- Why is the father running after the neighbor with an axe?
The son answers:
- He found out that you were cheating on him with a neighbor and decided to kill the neighbor, then he will kill you.
Mother by the head and run to the village. The neighbor's father did not catch up, returns and asks his son:
- Where the mother ran to.
Son:
- Yes, she found out that you were chasing a mare and ran to the village to tell everyone.
The father jumps up and runs after the mother. The son lights a cigarette, lies down under the stack and says:
- I said I wouldn't mow! So I won't!
