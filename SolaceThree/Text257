A wolf, a fox and a bear caught a whole bag of fish. We thought, thought about how to divide and decided who would say how much in rhyme, and take away so much. Fox:
- The fish was swimming on the bottom, I'm taking one for myself!
Wolf:
- The fish was swimming at the bottom, I'm taking two for myself!
The bear thought, but did not come up with anything sensible and says:
- I didn't come up with a single x%, I'm taking the whole bag!
