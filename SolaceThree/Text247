A young Muscovite comes to the village to visit his grandmother. Having nothing better to do, he begins to take care of a local beauty. One day the girl asks him:
- Could you explain to me what a penis is, because I've heard this word on TV so many times, but I don't know what it is.
The young man answers:
- Let me show you better.
He unbuttons his fly and pulls down his trousers. The girl looks, and then says:
- Well, this is the same as x%y, only much less.
