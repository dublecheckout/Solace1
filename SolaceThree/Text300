The traffic cop stops the man and asks:
- Did you drink alcohol today?
Guy:
 - No, of course not!
Traffic cop:
- Well, unfortunately, I don't have a breathalyzer with me, so I'll ask you a question. If you answer correctly, I'll let you go.
Guy:
 - All right, ask me.
Traffic cop:
 - You're driving along the road at night and you see two light sources ahead. What do you think it could be?
Guy:
 - Well, the car. Is not it so?
Traffic cop:
- Well, yes, but which one? Renault, Mercedes, Ford? Why are you silent? Well, I'll ask you one more question. You're driving at night, and there's only one light source in front of you. What could it be?
Guy:
 - Well, most likely, it's probably a motorcycle ...
traffic cop:
- Well, yes, but what kind of motorcycle? Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Java? Obviously, I'll have to detain you...
the guy got angry and asked:
 - Comrade Lieutenant, may I ask you a question?
Traffic cop:
- Yes, of course.
Guy:
 - A blonde in a miniskirt is standing on the side of the road, with a kind of cleavage that her breasts already fall out and slow down a passing truck. Who is it?
Traffic cop, smiling:
 - Well, it's clear that the whore... Who else?
Guy:
 - Well, yes, I see, but who exactly? Is it your sister, wife or daughter?
