A girl in a foreign car at a service station. The master asks:
- So what's wrong with your car?
Girl:
- She twitches and goes deaf.
The master lifted the hood, and under it a note:
- This fool can't drive. I won't pay. Husband.
The master closed the hood and says:
- I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do to help you.
Girl:
- What the hell is this? Already the sixth service is being refused!
