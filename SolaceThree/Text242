At night, I was woken up by a drunken voice coming from the street.
- Janaa! Janaa! Where are you, Janaa?
So for about twenty minutes with some intermittency. It's hot outside, so there was no desire to close the window. But there was another desire, to go out and knock this drunken Romeo into a tambourine. I began to watch, thinking how much I would be enough to overcome my laziness to get dressed. After the next one:
- Yanaa! Janaa!
A thin voice from the next window:
- What, honey?
Inspired by Romeo:
- Yana, I love you!
In response to him:
- And I love you! Now go home to sleep, I'll call you tomorrow.
Romeo sobbed joyfully:
- Good!
After which, with a joyful bounce, he disappeared from sight.
- A resourceful girl, my neighbor. By the way, she is Light, not what is not Yana...
