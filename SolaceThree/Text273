The wife heard a new word and asked her husband:
- Dear, what is an embarrassment?
Husband:
- Well, for example, you come home, and there I am with another woman in bed. So much for the embarrassment.
Wife:
- So it's embarrassing if you come home, and there I am with another man?
Husband:
- You give me an embarrassment here, don't confuse it with a feeling!
