Little Vovochka was walking with his mother in the park. Suddenly Vovochka wanted to pee and he screams at his mother:
- Mom, Mom, I want to write!
Mom pulls him back:
- Vovochka. You're already big, you can't talk so openly, there are people around. Speak up- I want to whistle. Understood?
Mom led Vovochka behind a tree, he did his business and he calmed down. At night, Vovochka comes to her parents' bedroom and pulls the hand of her dad sleeping on the edge:
- Dad, Dad, I want to whistle!
Dad, half asleep, squinting through his glasses at the clock:
- Vovochka, are you stunned? I almost drove you crazy. It's three o'clock in the morning!
Vovochka does not lag behind Dad:
- But I really want to!
Dad is trying to send this whistling lover to sleep in a hoarse whisper:
- Vovochka, mom is asleep, grandma is asleep, everyone is asleep, what kind of whistle. Go to bed too, tomorrow we'll whistle together as much as you want.
Vovochka, shifting from one foot to the other:
- Dad, I can't take it anymore. I'm going to start whistling right now!
Dad, turning over on his side and falling asleep, suggests:
- All right, all right, whistle. Just be quiet and in my ear.
