A female doctor cannot fall asleep because conscience and reason are arguing in her. Conscience:
- You can't sleep well after cheating on your husband!
The mind:
- It depends on which one! If the husband is always busy, he does not have time for sex, then the saint will change. It's right that you changed it! Sleep sweetly!
Conscience:
- Treason is treason! Copulating with a patient is a violation of medical ethics!
The mind:
- And remember Ivanova from the 25th polyclinic. She has sex with patients regularly and everyone is happy.
Conscience is silent. The woman falls asleep and suddenly conscience in a sarcastic whisper:
- But Ivanova is not a veterinarian...
