Two mice opened a bottle of vodka, but there were no snacks. A crow is sitting on a tree with a piece of cheese. They're for her:
- Crow, do you want a drink?
The crow howls:
- Of course I want to:
The cheese fell out of its beak, the mice grabbed the cheese and went into their hole. The next day, the mice returned to the tree:
- Crow, do you want a drink?
The crow is silent. One mouse pours vodka into a glass and asks:
- Is it full for you?
Crow:
- Full!
The cheese fell out and the mice and cheese were like that again.
The next day, the mice come back to the tree and ask:
- Crow, would you like a drink?
The crow is silent. The mouse pours vodka into a glass and asks:
- Do you like it as usual, full?
The crow is not responding.
One mouse for her:
- You probably think we're trying to trick you again?
Crow:
- Yeah!
