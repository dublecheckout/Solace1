Father says to Vovochka:
- Why did you tell everyone about how the math teacher and the physical education teacher kissed?
Vovochka:
- Well, she asked for it herself.
Father:
- You mean by yourself?
Vovochka repeats the words of the teacher:
- Vovochka, why are you laughing all the time in the back? Come on, tell me, we'll have a laugh with the whole class too!
