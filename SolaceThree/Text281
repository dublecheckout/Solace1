The husband, as it happens earlier, came home from work, went into the bedroom, and there the wife was lying in bed. He asks:
- Why did you get into bed?
Wife:
- Yes, something is wrong with the heart. So it knocks, so it knocks.
Husband:
- Go to the pharmacy, buy some drops, pills.
The wife begins to get ready for the pharmacy. The husband goes into another room, and there's the son. The son nods his head to his father:
"Uncle Kolya is hiding in the closet.
The husband goes back into the bedroom, opens the closet, and there's a neighbor. Husband:
- Kolyan your mother, my wife's heart has seized, and you are playing hide-and-seek with your son here!
