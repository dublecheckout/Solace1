My husband is on the Internet. Suddenly, his wife's voice is barely audible:
- No, no, honey, it won't work today, let's meet tomorrow.
The husband immediately runs into his wife's room:
- Did you talk on the phone?
Wife:
- no. I'm reading a women's magazine, the article is interesting, it contains 50 phrases that need to be read out loud, like dear, please throw out the garbage, when will you finally nail the curtain? And in the same article it says that a busy husband will hear only the 51st half-whispered.
- It really works...
