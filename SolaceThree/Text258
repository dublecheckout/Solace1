The mother-in-law decided to check which of the three sons-in-law she loves more. They are walking with their eldest son-in-law near the pond. The mother-in-law goes for a swim and begins to drown. The eldest son-in-law jumps into the water and saves her. The next day, he goes out into the yard and there is a new Volga car near his house with a note:
- To his beloved son-in-law from his mother-in-law!
It's the same story with the middle son-in-law. As a gift, a Lada with the same note. He goes with the younger one. He starts to drown, but he thinks:
- To the senior "Volga", to the average "Zhiguli", then I get a "Zaporozhets" type? No, let him drown.
The mother-in-law drowned, and the next day the younger son-in-law goes out into the yard and sees a Mercedes car near his house with a note:
- To his beloved son-in-law from his father-in-law!
