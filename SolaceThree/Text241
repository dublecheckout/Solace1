During the fire, a brunette, a redhead and a blonde got out on the roof. Firefighters have deployed and are holding the canopy down. They shout at the brunette:
- Jump!
The brunette jumps, while the firefighters remove the canopy. The brunette breaks into a pancake. Screaming red:
- Jump!
The redhead is crying:
- Yeah, jump, and remove the canopy.
The firefighters replied:
- we will not remove it. We just don't like brunettes. And we love redheads.
The redhead jumps. Firefighters are removing the canopy again. The redhead is going to be crushed to a pulp. They shout at the blonde:
- Jump!
She replied to them:
"Well, no, you can't fool me. Put the canopy on the ground and step back!
