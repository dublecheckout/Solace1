A pretty drunk man came to the dentist for an appointment, with a terrible toothache:
 - Doctor, help me, I'm dying of pain!
The DOCTOR:
- And my working day is already over!
Guy:
 - Well, at least give me some advice!
Doctor:
- The traditional method... Take a thread, tie the end and pull hard.
The next day, a call from the intensive care unit.
 - Did you advise the patient yesterday to tie the end and pull hard?
THE DOCTOR:
- Yes.
In response:
 - Maybe now you can advise how to sew this "end" into place?
