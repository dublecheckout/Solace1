A stuttering girl on the street, asks a guy:
"Tell me, what time is it?"
The guy is silent. She asked again, he was silent. The girl was offended and left. The woman standing next to me asks:
- Was it difficult for you to answer what time it was? You have a watch on your hand.
The guy answers:
- A-a-a-ha. What-about-getting-punched in the face?
