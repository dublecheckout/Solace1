The plane gets into a disaster, the entire crew, passengers, and among them a famous football team die. The Apostle Peter stands at the gates of paradise and sorts:
- So, the crew and innocent victims go to heaven, and the football players go to hell!
The team wanders dejectedly towards hell. The Apostle shouts:
- Hey, center for number 15! You can go to heaven!
He asks:
- But why only me?
The Apostle Peter:
- I saw your last game. You're not a football player!
