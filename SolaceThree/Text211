My grandfather and grandmother lived. The pension is small, there is not enough money. And since they haven't had sex for a long time, they decided to take it, hand over their pussies to a thrift store. They handed over and gave them 80 rubles.24 kopecks . They came home and let's split the money. The grandmother says:
- Well, the old one in half, you are 40 rubles. 12 kopecks, and I am the same! Everything is fair.
Grandfather:
- What is it in half? Do you know how much my household was valued? All the money is mine!
Grandma:
- No, that won't do! Now let's go back and ask who they rated for what!
They returned to the thrift store and asked the receptionist:
- We handed over our stuff a couple of hours ago, could you tell me what's the reason?
The receptionist opened the book, looking for:
- I found it. So, a worn silver fox with gray hair costs 80 rubles and a string with bells costs 24 kopecks.
