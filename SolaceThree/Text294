A Russian, a Frenchman and an American are flying on the plane. The Frenchman sticks his hand out of the plane, then sniffed it and said:
- France.
The others ask him:
- How did you guess?
Frenchman:
- It smells like French perfume.
After a while, the American pulls out his hand, then sniffed it and said:
- America.
They ask him:
- How did you find out?
The American:
- The air is saturated with money.
After a while, the Russian pulls out his hand and says:
- Mother Russia!
The Frenchman and the American ask:
- How do you know
Russian?:
- The clock is 100% off!
