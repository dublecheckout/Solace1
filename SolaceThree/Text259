A man walks through the desert, and hears the voice of the almighty from above:
- Stop and dig in this place. There is a treasure buried here.
The man was delighted and started digging, but found nothing. He spat and walked on. Suddenly, the same voice again:
- Stop! Dig here!
The man started digging again and again found nothing. He got angry, cursed, spat and walked on. There goes the voice again:
- Dig, there's a treasure here!
The man at first goes on without paying attention, but then suddenly returns and starts digging. He digs and stumbles upon a chest, opens it, and there are countless treasures there. A voice from above:
- That's not a fucking thing for me!
