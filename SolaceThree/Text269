A girl is standing on the balcony, and a man is walking by. The girl suddenly screams at him:
- Man, I'm afraid of you!
Man:
- That's crazy. What are you afraid of me for?
Girl:
- You're going to rape me.
Guy:
- How can I rape you if I'm downstairs and you're on the balcony?
Girl:
- I'm already coming down...
