The family is being judged by the Romanesque. Interviewing witnesses. Judge to the neighbor:
- Witness, answer the court. Did the neighbor give you drugs?
Neighbour
- No, Your Honor.
Judge:
- Did his wife give it to you?
The witness answers in confusion for a few seconds:
- I'm sorry, Your Honor. Are we still talking about drugs?
