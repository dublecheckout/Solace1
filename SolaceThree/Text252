A seventy-year-old granny found her husband in bed with another woman. In a fit of jealousy, she threw him off the balcony and he fell to his death. During the trial, the judge asked her:
- Can you say anything in your defense?
Granny says:
- Your Honor, I thought if my husband is able to have sex at the age of ninety, then he can fly.
