The grandfathers gathered on the bench and chatted. One tells:
- I met a girl on the street yesterday. I offered her a drink, she agreed! He took her to a pub. We drank and had a snack.
The grandfathers opened their mouths in anticipation. He continues:
- I invited her to my house and she came to me.
One of the grandfathers couldn't help himself:
- In short. So in the end, did you blow her?
He answers:
- Well, not that I blew it. I'm screwed!
