- Tell me, your bank gave me a loan, practically without any documents, certificates, guarantors...
- And if I don't give it back?

- Well, then you will be very ashamed when you appear before the Almighty at the last judgment.
The man to the manager:
- Well, when will it be...
the manager says:
- If you do not pay on the fifth, then you will appear on the sixth!
